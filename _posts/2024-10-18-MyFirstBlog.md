Hello, My name is Stephen. I'm a backend developer with significant experience in high-performance systems. I write this blog to share my technical skills with everyone, At the same time, I can improve my writing skills.
In the writing process, I may make some spelling and grammar errors, but I hope you can tolerate me because this is the first time I have written a technical blog. In this blog, I will strive to leverage all my experience to share useful knowledge with you. My expertise is Backend and AI development, so I can share deeply and dive into this domain, beside this, I can share about Frontend, DevOps, and Mobile development if I have a chance.
