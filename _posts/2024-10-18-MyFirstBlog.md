## Introduction (Who I Am)

Hello, my name is Stephen. I'm a backend developer with significant experience in high-performance systems. I created this blog to share my technical skills with others and to improve my writing skills along the way.

While writing, I might make a few spelling or grammar mistakes, but I hope you can be patient with me as this is my first time writing a technical blog. My goal is to leverage my experience to provide valuable and practical knowledge. My primary areas of expertise are backend and AI development, so you can expect in-depth discussions in these fields. However, I will also occasionally cover topics related to frontend, DevOps, and mobile development whenever possible.

## My Journey into Development

From my real-life experiences, I believe that sharing and contributing to the community is the best way to learn and grow. I’m committed to giving back as much as I can by sharing my knowledge with the technical community.

My career started in frontend development, but I soon transitioned into backend work. Sometimes, it feels like fate led me to this path, but I find backend development much more suitable for me. I’m drawn to its logical, structured nature compared to the more design-oriented and visually intricate world of frontend development.

I began my journey with PHP, thinking I could do everything with this language. However, after a year of working with it, I realized that while PHP is great for web development, other domains require more specialized tools. I then learned Java, which opened the door to more complex and scalable solutions.

As I progressed in my career and joined larger companies, I had the opportunity to work in teams that used multiple backend languages. This experience helped me gain proficiency in Golang and Node.js. I also built a strong foundation in Python during my university studies, which further broadened my technical expertise.
