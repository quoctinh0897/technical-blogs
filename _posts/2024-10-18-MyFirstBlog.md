## Introduction (Who I Am)
Hello, My name is Stephen. I'm a backend developer with significant experience in high-performance systems. I write this blog to share my technical skills with everyone, At the same time, I can improve my writing skills.
In the writing process, I may make some spelling and grammar errors, but I hope you can tolerate me because this is the first time I have written a technical blog. In this blog, I will strive to leverage all my experience to share useful knowledge with you. My expertise is Backend and AI development, so I can share deeply and dive into this domain, beside this, I can share about Frontend, DevOps, and Mobile development if I have a chance.

From my real-life experience, I think sharing and contributing to the community is the best way to learn and improve my skills. I hope to contribute as much as I can with my knowledge to the technical community. I started with Frontend but switched to Backend. Sometimes it's fate and destiny but I find this field suitable for me. Because I like something logical and rude of the Backend than the graceful, ornate of Frontend. Start with PHP with the mindset that I could do everything with this language, but after 1 year first, I realized PHP was only suited for web development, and with other domains, we needed something more magical than it, and I chose Java as the next language I learn. After that, I switch companies to bigger companies and I join a team with flexible language in the Backend team so I learn Golang and Node JS more. Besides this, I learn Python at my university.
